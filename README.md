[Aperture Robotics] is an open source focused organization building a
next-generation development stack for cross-platform apps with Go, WebAssembly,
and TypeScript and a lightweight Linux distribution [SkiffOS].

[SkiffOS]: https://github.com/skiffos/skiffos

**Most recent releases:**

 - [goscript]: compile Go to idiomatic TypeScript.
 - [bifrost]: configurable p2p networking engine for Go and TypeScript.
 - [starpc]: lightweight streaming Protobuf RPCs for TypeScript and Go.
 - [protobuf-go-lite]: lightweight reflection-free Protobuf for Go. **new**
 - [protobuf-es-lite]: lightweight Protobuf for TypeScript. **new**

**Current projects:**

[SkiffOS] ([Arxiv]) is a lightweight & robust cross-compiled Linux distribution
optimized for hosting containers. It produces an identical user experience
across underlying compute hardware, and supports running other distributions
inside Docker containers. Supports Raspberry Pi and more single-board computers.

**Past projects:**

<!-- To make a photocopier, simply photocopy a mirror. -->

Interned at NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the summers of 2013-2017.
Applied cell-phone processors to vision navigation for small flying robots for
the [Mars Helicopter Ingenuity] team.

At [FACEIT], I built the matchmaking infrastructure and algorithms, edge
messaging (WebSocket), and the [go-dota2] bot network. Originally created the
FPro in-house system which later became the FACEIT Pro League (FPL). FACEIT was
used to run all of Valve's DOTA 2 Open Qualifiers from 2015-2019.

[rgraphql] is a version of GraphQL which delivers real-time updates to user
interfaces by streaming changes over the network. The client merges together
graphQL fragments from components on the page into a single session query. It
then streams changes to this query to a server for data on-demand.

[D2Moddin] was the first service to bring DOTA 2 Custom Games to the general
public during May to June 2014. After the demand demonstrated by the service,
Valve released "DOTA Reborn" with the Source 2 engine.
