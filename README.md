### Hi, welcome to my GitHub profile üç∞

[Aperture Robotics] is a framework for decentralized software and real-time user
interfaces which runs on any platform, including the web browser and embedded
devices, with a single Go codebase. Streamlines the process of building and
managing large-scale embedded linux, peer-to-peer, and robotics projects.

[Aperture Robotics]: https://github.com/aperturerobotics

**Most recent releases:**

 - [starpc]: Protobuf streaming RPCs for TypeScript and Go.
 - [bifrost]: configurable p2p networking engine written in Go.
 - [protobuf-project]: code-gen based project structure for Protobuf.

**Current projects:**

[SkiffOS] ([Arxiv]) is a lightweight & robust cross-compiled Linux distribution
optimized for hosting containers. It produces an identical user experience
across underlying compute hardware, and supports running other distributions
inside Docker containers. Supports Raspberry Pi and more single-board computers.

[rgraphql] is a version of GraphQL which delivers real-time updates to user
interfaces by streaming changes over the network. The client merges together
graphQL fragments from components on the page into a single session query. It
then streams changes to this query to a server for data on-demand.

Interned at NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory during the summers of 2013-2017.
Applied cell-phone processors to vision navigation for small flying robots for
the [Mars Helicopter Ingenuity] team.

At [FACEIT], I built the matchmaking infrastructure and algorithms, edge
messaging (WebSocket), and the [go-dota2] bot network. Originally created the
FPro in-house system which later became the FACEIT Pro League (FPL). FACEIT was
used to run all of Valve's DOTA 2 Open Qualifiers from 2015-2019.

[D2Moddin] was the first service to bring DOTA 2 Custom Games to the general
public during May to June 2014. After the demand demonstrated by the service,
Valve released "DOTA Reborn" with custom modes and Source 2 engine.
